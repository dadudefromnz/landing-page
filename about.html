                <h2>Years of experience</h2>
                <p>General Fencing Ltd began when Barry retired from dairy farming. He started off small, providing various farm services to clients throughout the Waikato,
                  including relief milking, weed spraying and fencing. Eventually, he upgraded his tractor and rammer and specialised in fencing.
                </p>
                <p>Barry has years of experience in not just fencing, but farming too. Whatever specific needs you have, Barry knows not every job is the same and strives to provide a fencing solution that works for <em>you</em>.
